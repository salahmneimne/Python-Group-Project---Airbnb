# Airbnb Listings – Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)

## Overview
This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Airbnb listing data to uncover patterns in pricing, availability, and host behavior.  
The goal is to transform raw data into **actionable insights** using Python-based data analysis tools.

---

## Scope & Objectives
- Understand price distribution and variability
- Analyze availability and demand patterns
- Explore relationships between location, room type, and price
- Identify outliers and data quality issues
- Support data-driven insights for short-term rental markets

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

---

## Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling missing values and outliers
- Descriptive statistics
- Feature exploration and correlations
- Visualizations (histograms, boxplots, scatter plots)

---

## Key Insights
- Pricing varies significantly by location and room type
- Availability patterns reveal seasonal and demand-driven effects
- Certain listing attributes strongly influence price

---

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Applying EDA best practices in Python
- Translating raw data into visual insights
- Improving data quality before modeling
- Communicating findings through clear visualizations

---

## Notes
- Data is used for academic purposes only
- Analysis focuses on insight generation, not prediction
